# What this repo has
A spring boot product catalog backend application configured with MySQL db.

Initially aimed for GUVI spring task 1. But ended up creating some unwanted variables and classes
* * createdAt, 
* * updatedAt in the Product class and the 
* * ProductDTO class
* So, after creation of the application, this is the folder containing the above unnecessary files as well.
